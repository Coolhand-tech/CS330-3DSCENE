# CS330-3DSCENE

Working on the 3D Scene project for CS 330 was both challenging and rewarding. When I approach designing software, I try to start by breaking down the problem and figuring out the steps needed to reach a solution. For this project, that meant thinking about how to set up a 3D scene, deciding which objects to include, and planning how to position and texture them. I focused on making my scene visually cohesive and organized my code so that it was easier to manage. Working on this project helped me develop new design skills, especially in terms of planning how multiple elements interact in a 3D space. I also learned to think critically about lighting and textures and how these choices affect the overall feel of the scene. My design process was iterative—I sketched ideas, tried different layouts in the program, and adjusted until it looked right. I can see how this approach will help me in future projects, as planning and revising designs early saves time and leads to better results.

When it came to developing the program, I focused on breaking the work into smaller, manageable tasks. I experimented with shaders, textures, and lighting settings, and I learned to test frequently so I could see how changes affected the scene. Iteration played a huge role in my development process; I would make adjustments to the placement of objects, tweak the lighting, and refine textures over several rounds until the scene looked polished. This project showed me the importance of experimenting and being patient with trial and error. Throughout the milestones, my approach to coding became more structured—I started planning more before writing code and used modular functions to keep things organized. By the time I completed the project, I felt more confident in my ability to create a full 3D environment from scratch.

Learning computational graphics and visualization through this project has given me new skills that I can apply in both my educational and professional paths. I now have hands-on experience with creating and manipulating 3D objects, setting up lighting, and designing scenes, which could be valuable in fields like game development, simulations, and interactive applications. These skills also help me think about problems visually and logically at the same time, which strengthens my overall problem-solving abilities in computer science. I feel that completing this project not only improved my technical skills but also gave me a better understanding of the development process from design to final implementation.

Overall, this project reinforced the value of careful planning, iteration, and experimentation. It showed me how much thought goes into creating a polished 3D scene and gave me practical experience that I can build on in future courses and projects. I’m proud of the work I’ve done, and adding this project to my portfolio will serve as a reminder of the skills I’ve gained and the effort I put into bringing my ideas to life.
